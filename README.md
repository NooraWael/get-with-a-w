# get-with-a-w

hello hello peoples 

so we divide everything into 4 parts 

1) Main downloading function - Noora
2) mirroring
3) flags person 1
4) flags person 2

please be sure to document everything so the person that comes after you does not suffer and because we are nice :D

## Documentation 
To further ensure that the functions are defined properly the follow comments should be added to all the functions

1) Brief Description
2) Parameters
3) Return Value
4) Example Usage

this would also help us with generating the documentation automatically 

### Example 
```
/**
 * Prints the provided string to the console.
 * 
 * @param text - The text string to be printed. This function expects a non-null string.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example of printing a greeting message.
 * printText("Hello, world!");
 * // Output: Hello, world!
 */
export function printText(text: string): void {
  console.log(text);
}

```
