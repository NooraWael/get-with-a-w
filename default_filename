<p>I do all my writing in a text file. Not any text file or “text
files.” I mean one single .txt file.</p>
<p>All my notes, blog posts, ideas, essays - anything not written in pen
or pencil - live in or begin life in this document and its copies.
Everything I post online is just a copy-paste.</p>
<p>Sounds chaotic, right? Maybe it is, a little. But not as much as you
might think. Personally, I think it’s removed the distractions and fuss
of previous workflows I’ve tried.</p>
<p>But to be clear, what I’m about to share is not some productivity
hack. It won’t automate your workflow, “link your thinking,” or make
writing easy. You could think of it as a lazy man’s PKM. Though it’s
more for knowledge dumping than “knowledge management.”</p>
<p>For the record, I think the most “powerful” note-taking and writing
system is the one that you find enjoyable to use, allows you to retrieve
old ideas, and inspires you to write and think every day. Anything more
is superfluous and might actually get in the way.</p>
<p>To this end, a notebook with an index (which I also use) is perfectly
viable. As is a folder on your desktop or the note software on your
phone.</p>
<p>And so is One Big Text File (OBTF).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-obtf">What is OBTF?</h2>
<p>Using OBTF is not a new idea. It was relatively popular among niche
blogosphere circles in the mid-2000s. As far as I can tell from the
surviving posts, the concept can be traced back to some <a
href="https://craphound.com/lifehacks2.txt">observations</a> by tech
journalist Danny O’Brien regarding how technologists work.</p>
<p>In any case, the premise behind OBTF is simple. It is the idea of
keeping everything - or nearly everything - in one .txt (or .md) file.
You might use it to store to-do lists, URLs, meeting notes, a
reading log, a calendar, blog entries, essays, or pretty much anything
else. However, I wouldn’t suggest using it to store sensitive
information like passwords, your darkest secrets or bank details.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask why anyone would remove all the categorization
benefits of having separate files and folders. And wouldn’t the result
be an unwieldy mess? Well, in my experience, finding things in OBTF is
blazingly fast.</p>
<p>To be clear, I don’t scroll through my OBTF looking for things. That
really would be hell. I don’t even touch a keypad or a mouse. Instead, I
use tags and search. The latter of which can be done using hotkeys found
on pretty much any modern text editor.</p>
<p>The base of my daily workflow is reading, thinking, and dumping
thoughts that I think are worth remembering or writing (because a note
is not always something you need to remember, but often something you
need to <a href="https://mikegrindle.com/posts/write-to-think">write to
think</a> about) into my file. When there’s something I want to talk
about more extensively, I look over my previous notes on the subject and
start writing right there in said file.</p>
<p>Once I’ve written and am relatively happy with a long-form piece of
writing, I’ll copy it over into a new .md file, run a few
grammar-checking scripts (largely pinched from <a
href="https://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/?source=techstories.org">here</a>),
convert the .md file into an HTML file using a program called <a
href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> and upload it to my site (or
copy-paste it to wherever I need).</p>
<p>The above may sound like a lot of work, but it mostly happens from my
OS’s terminal with a handful of commands. I’m sure a similar workflow
could be achieved just as easily using GUI tools.</p>
<p>Again, if the system sounds imperfect, that’s because it is. The
appeal is not perfect “knowledge management.” It’s about removing any
friction from my workflow.</p>
<p>OBTF lets me throw in knowledge, forget about it, and <em>maybe</em>
retrieve it later. It’s kind of like a notebook in that sense. And as
far as I’m aware, no one has yet <em>proven</em> there to be a
<em>better</em> system than a notebook. So, why not replicate that?</p>
<h2 id="why-would-i-do-this">Why would I do this?</h2>
<p>What are the benefits of working like this? For me, a few points
come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero distractions (no fiddling with formatting, fonts, plug-ins, or
shiny new productivity tools - markdown formatting handles
everything)</li>
<li>Miniscule storage and processing. Even a massive .txt file will run
nicely on relatively ancient hardware and lightweight operating
systems</li>
<li>Easy to sync data between computers</li>
<li>Can “dump” notes without worrying about where they “fit” in a
system</li>
<li>Works with any text editor with search functionality (so, all of
them), meaning there’s no fear of client lock-in, software
enshittification, or losing access to your data. .txt will always be
platform, system, and application-independent</li>
<li>Everything can be found in one place with relative ease. That means
no logging into the cloud or switching between software to find
stuff</li>
<li>Basically, zero task-switching</li>
<li>It works well with a mouse/keypad-free workflow</li>
<li>As the text file grows, you can look back at your progress (all
those ticked to-do lists) and the progression of your thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are potential drawbacks to OBTF as well. If you
don’t use tags, things will get lost (I’d argue some things are
<em>meant</em> to be lost, but I digress). Also, if you’re not used to
working with .txt files or text editors, the lack of inline formatting
could be a little disorientating at first.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I feel like OBTF manages to achieve a lot of the things
PKM software promises with none of the fuss, set-up, or anxiety about
using the “right” methodology (I probably couldn’t sell you a course on
the “right way” to use a One Big Text File. Don’t worry, I don’t want to
either). In any case, it works for me.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>I have an inkling that very few people who read this will attempt to
implement their own OBTF. This is okay. Despite my personal love for the
idea, I don’t want your big takeaway to be that using a big text file is
the future. It isn’t.</p>
<p>What I will say is that whatever works, works. And it doesn’t need to
be fancy.</p>
<p>Of course, you can keep your notes, ideas, and writing in a
cutting-edge PKM program if that works for you. You can also use a
notebook, index cards, a big f’n text file, a blog, or just keep a bunch
of files in a folder. The truth is that the medium and the tools don’t
matter. What matters is that you get that stuff in your head down.
Tomorrow’s revelation might just be the fleeting thought you had
today.</p>
